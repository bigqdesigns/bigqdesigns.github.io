    <div p class="gettoknow"> Does anyone else remember those list of questions that went around in the early 2000's? Figured that's a fun way to meet me - the guy behind bigQDesigns.
    <br> <br>
    1. Where did you grow up?
    Rural Ohio.. not exactly the most Queer friendly place.. but I made it out.
    <br>
2. Where do you live now?
    Palm Springs, California.  Yes - it's hot in the summer.  Yes - it's mostly older people.  Yes - I love it.
    <br>
3. Dogs or Cats?
    Both!  Currently I have a cat named Felicia.
    <br>
  4. Favorite Drink?
    Lemondrop Martini - a classic that is pretty hard to mess up.
    <br>
5. Tea of Coffee?
    Coffee - preferably iced with milk/splenda.
    <br>
6. Which languages do you speak?
    English currently - attempting to learn german.  "Kaffee und milch, bitte!"
    <br>
7. Favorite Movie?
    The Wizard of Oz - forever and always.  As a child I only watched 3 films in rotation and this was one of them.
    <br>
  8. Favorite Drag Anthem?
    Proud by Heather Small - it was the first drag performance I'd ever seen.
    <br>
9. Favorite Queer Bar?
    Bounce in Cleveland was where I had my Queer coming of age - unfortunately it's closed.
    <br>
10. Why bigQDesigns?
    It's a play on words from one of my favorite TV shows - Queer as Folk.
